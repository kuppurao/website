Gone are the times we used to visit a neighbor’s to watch TV. Technology is omnipresent in all businesses, most homes so much so that it is now part and parcel of hospitality.

What am I talking about?

Every home today not only has a computer but also internet connectivity.

How many times have you had to tell your guest how to connect to your home network?

So, in the past, when a guest comes home, you are like “Welcome home! Please sit. What can I get for you? Coffee, Juice?”

These days I find myself doing this — “Welcome home! What can I get for you? Coffee, Juice…by the way you can use my computer to check your emails if you want” or better yet “Welcome home! What can I get for you? Coffee, Juice…by the way my wireless network name is _whatever_, it is an encrypted network…please use password of _whateverelse_.”

Dont know what you think….I definitely see signs of internet being part of home style hospitality.
