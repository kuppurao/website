One of the core tenets of sound personal finance is — don’t spend more than you have. But that’s really just the beginning. You ought to be saving 30–50% of your earnings to future-proof yourself for the sake of ageing and for family. 

I have seen many of my friends not have a credit card at all. They manage to live with just a debit card, because, guess what, it works. And that’s fine. But there are intelligent ways of using revolving credit to your advantage. But anyone that thinks credit card without 100% compliance to these rules, is missing the point. 

1.  Never skip, miss, or delay payments
2.  Never — never — pay anything less than 100% of your balance 
3.  Never max out or even be close to it on your credit cards
