Alright, this post in the [Spellbound](http://kuppurao.com/blog/category/spellbound-2/) series is not completely wordless. This datapoint comes from the book I just read and reviewed. There is a myth that IT (Information Technology) industry will somehow rescue India from its problems. While this is true from a positioning perspective (that is gives us image, provides level-playing field, helps builds IP etc…), the numbers don’t match the truth we are refusing to accept or even trying to hide. The below picture is a representation of how many people pay income taxes.
