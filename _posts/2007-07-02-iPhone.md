iPhone’s good. iPhone’s bad. iPhone’s ugly.  
 iPhone has activation issues. No, they have now been resolved.  
 iPhone is the next best thing to sliced bread. iPhone is a fad.

We’ve heard it all.

What does iPhone mean to [Mr. Jobs](http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html) and to Mr. Stephenson?

iPhone costs $499 and $599 for the 4gb and 8gb versions. I read somewhere that half a million iPhones might have been sold in the past 3 days.

Read my [original iPhone review](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2007/07/iphone-first-looks/ "iPhone – First looks")

Assuming every 3rd person bought the 8gb version, Apple alone made $266 million just in the past 3 days. If the [rumor I heard about the iPhone cost](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2007/tc2007072_957316.htm) is true, about 63% of this is direct profit to Apple. And each time you buy an extra pair of ear phones or charger or skin or iTunes or anything, you give them extra pocket-money.

And if 0.5 million of them had new or extended 2-year contracts from AT&T; — the minimum plan being $59.99 — AT&T; has secured revenues of over $720 million over the next 2 years. Just in the past 3 days. You can also give extra money to AT&T; by going for higher value plans (up to $179.99 a month) or give pocket money by going for lower value plan and using more minutes than you have. AT&T; will have a lot to plan and execute as far their support is concerned. Moreover, until Apple comes up with a 3G version of iPhone, AT&T; has nothing to worry about their network capacity. Because EDGE is slow anyways.

So, who is the winner? I am not sure, but I know who the loser is.
