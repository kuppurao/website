One poem I like…  
 — — — — -

If you can keep your head when all about you,  
 And losing their’s and blaming it on you ;  
 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
 But make allowance for their doubting too;  
 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting  
 Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
 Or being hated don’t give way to hating  
 And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream — and not make dreams your master ;  
 If you can think — and not make thoughts your aims  
 If you can meet with triumph and disaster  
 And treat those impostors just the same ;  
 If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap of fools  
 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
 And stoop and build ’em with worn-out tools

If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
 And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss  
 And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
 And never breathe a word about your loss ;  
 If you can force your heart and nerve and sine  
 To serve your turn along after they’re gone  
 And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
 Except the Will which says to them, :’Hold on’

If you can walk with crowds & keep your virtue,  
 Or walk with kings,-nor lose the common touch  
 If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
 If all men count with you, but none too much ;  
 If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
 With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  
 Yours is the earth and everything that’s in it,  
 And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son !

Trivia: Did you know Kipling was born in and spent the initial part of his life in India?
