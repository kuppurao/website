Full disclosure — I support it

Death Penalty intrigues me. In part because it deals with death. Entire civilizations have tried to understand Death over several centuries. Detailed constructs have been devised around death — mythological concepts, astrophysical concepts, religious concepts, folklore — yet death may be one of the most under-understood concepts affecting man. Cultures have invented bizarre, weird, sometimes frightening customs and rituals to combat death. After-death possibilities are speculated, some cultures believe in rebirth. Kids are taught to be _this_ and _that_, because they have to be wary of what will happen to them after they die. Science takes shots at death — de-ageing, resurrection etc.. — from time to time.

Death Penalty intrigues me. Because it deals with the circumstances of one’s death. The person is not dying by ailment or a tragic accident — but in circumstances that are extremely controlled/ controllable. They say in general — dying people know they are about to die moments before their death. We may never know the truth — but Death Row inmates have a degree of certainty and finality to their lives. Determined by something external.

A Death Row inmate I imagine will go through a certain type of mental agony which is hard to comprehend unless you are one. Exactly what is “State”? How can a bunch of people determine when I should die? And what is this about a swaths of people watching me die? Am I a specimen? And what about “stayed” decisions? What about executions that gets delayed? How can my final moment be controlled by so many people? What about conviction reversals? DNA? What about corrupt investigations? And incomplete investigations? What if I am wrongly convicted? Did I give my life away for a bunch of imbeciles?

I am also curious about the drama that engulfs death penalty. Prisons constantly run out of supplies. They constantly get poor quality supplies. How does it matter if they shot me or gave me a cocktail? How does it matter that I am physically and mentally stable? Or, why should it matter? And what is this “last meal” thing? Does it matter that I eat my favorite meal before I die? Does it matter to the State that I didn’t necessarily afford my victim this? For crying out loud, does it matter what the last meal costs? Should the State take the burden for buying an extra side of French Fries?
