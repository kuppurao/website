NetworkComputing.com has an [excellent comparison](http://www.networkcomputing.com/applications/guide-vdi-evaluating-top-vendors/1146540291) of Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) provided by leading Cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and VMWare. With increased SaaS-ification of everything, in my view, the entire idea of a desktop is being challenged or will be challenged. In time, we may not even need a thing called the desktop or any form of an operating system per user. However, today, many organizations are dealing with this huge liability called the desktop — and spending millions on managing them, protecting them and so on.

DaaS purely as a concept of and a method for replacing desktops may not make sense. DaaS has to work with the rest of your infrastructure strategy (the proximity of your desktops with the users, servers and applications, customers etc..), so it can be implemented as an overall solution to free the user from managed devices.
