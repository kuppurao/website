Christmas Wish

I am not going to talk politics. But when the current President is out – 1 or 2 terms we don’t know – graceful or nasty exit we don’t know – there will be a hopefully a realization in the people of the world and more importantly, the people of United States that whatever happened in 2016 and whatever happened since 2016 is an aberration. 

The most important thing – or so I think – is that we have had less capable presidents. And presidents that made equally bad if not worse decisions. But none of them stooped to the level the current President has – he single handedly managed to ignore facts, ignore diplomacy, ignore decency, play the victim card while being the perpetrator of violence against so many values. Oh, and he managed to earn the title of Tweeter in Chief.

So here’s what we want the next president to not do. 

1.   Please, please don’t have social media handles of your own. Where social engagement is needed, have your office do it. Where direct communication is needed, go to the press yourself or use the press briefings. 
2.  Talk less. You don’t have to have an opinion about everything. Of course, you can as an individual – which is no more or less than my opinion. Presidential opinions should be reserved for policy discussions. 
3.  Hire great people, trust them, empower them and do everything you can do retain them. 
4.  Don’t use diametrically opposite positions to further your appeal. To be fair, past presidents have done this also. But you don’t have to. The younger generation is smarter and will do fact checks. Even if they don’t, consistency is a bitch. It will show who you truly are.
