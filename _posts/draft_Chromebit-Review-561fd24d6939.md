There are ton of over-the-top (OTT) devices you can buy to connect to your TV, but Chromebit is different. It can do some of what Chromecast can do, or Roku for that matter. But it is way more than that. Here’s my quick review of Chromebit.

Depending on your use case, you can define Chromebit as one or more of the follwowing — 

1.  Cheapest full-feature browser your TV can buy — Most modern TVs have browsers, but they leave much to be desired. Chromebit features Chrome which is as good a browser as can you get. 
2.  Functional thin client — if you have a virtual desktop or access your work PC remotely, you can use RDP clients natively or through a VPN connection. Cloud based desktop providers all have a thin client for Chromebit. 
3.  Desktop by itself — Let’s face it. Mostly we run browsers on desktops. Most things we call “apps” are really URLs. When was the last time you installed a software?
