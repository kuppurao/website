The who and what

We frequently get caught up in the discussion of “it’s not important who is saying it, only what is being said”.

Really?

Is that a comfortable position to take? If I said America is going into another Great Depression, do you care? Does anyone? Now imagine the same thing being said by a Wall Street CEO or Treasury Secretary, you take cover and move your assets elsewhere. When a straight person says gay people are gay by choice, does it mean anything? If an actually gay person said the same thing, it is completely different. 

My point is who is equally if not more important than what. But that logic has shortcomings too. This logic is what causes powerful people to abuse their power. 

So what’s the explanation? In my perspective, the answer lies in intention. Intention may be the most powerful factor in human behavior. If you fix the intentions of your employee or neighbor or the next Presidential candidate, you have almost fixed the problem itself. 

When our friends say “what, not who”, they forget the other dimension that is “why”.
