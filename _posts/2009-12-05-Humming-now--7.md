It was more than 10 years ago when I listened to this album called _Colours_ with Kunnakudi on Violin, Zakir on Tabla, Sivamani on Drums and Dilip Kumar (now AR Rehman) on keyboards. One song particularly intrigued me, that I listened to it countless times afterwards. It is almost like Zakir doing the melody on this song, coz his Tabla speaks, literally.

The raaga I am humming now is Hindolam

Such a beautiful raaga, I cannot put in words how much I enjoy listening to a Hindolam.

Fav #1: Ma Ramanan (esp Bombay Jayashree rendition of this Papanasam Sivan composition)

Fav #2: Sama Gana Lolane sung by Sowmya

Samajavaragamana is a quintessential Hindolam and I have not mentioned it here because I canâ€™t pick whose rendition I like.

Lite #1: Dharisanam Kidaikkadha (Alaigal Oyvadhillai / Ilayaraja)

Lite #2: Malai Pozhudhin Mayakkathil (Parthal Pasi Theerum / Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy)

Lite #3: Pothi Vecha Malligai Mottu (Man Vaasanai / Ilayaraja)

Update:

Per [Adithi](http://adithikoushik.blogspot.com/), Malai Pozhudhin is a Chandrakauns, not a Hindolam. Not sure about Pothi Vecha too.

For now, lets keep Lite #2 as Om Namachivaya (Salangai Oli / Ilayaraja)
