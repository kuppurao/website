The honeymoon period is over — ebooks are now as expensive as regular books.

When Kindle and Apple’s Books app came about, there were popular debates on whether paper books would continue to exist. However, the choice was excruciatingly simple — pay $10 for a regular book or $8 for an e-book. Reduced cost on the publisher meant more profits despite of reduced revenue.

I see a new trend emerging. Paperbacks are quietly being dropped from the online retail (read: Amazon) — with usually only 2 real options.

Consider this figure — at $12 for paperback and $10 for Kindle, the price comparison was $2 favoring Kindle. Now paperbacks are being dropped, and Kindle prices have been spiked up, only to be compared with the much higher-priced hardcovers.

In the last 4 occasions, I have resorted to paperbacks bought from marketplace, completing avoiding this drama and usually at prices less than paperbacks (<$12 in this example)
