The closest India has to pop music is film music. Most attempts of playing film music has been around the reproduction or re-rendition of it. Fans of film music have particular obsession towards seeing to that it is sung or played the exact same way as the original – including sometimes the mistakes in the original.

Film music has – to the best of my knowledge – never been subject of serious contemplation. Until Prasanna, that is. 

Whether it is Ilayaraja or MSV or the 80s music directors of Bollywood, he takes their music and makes it his own. Bends genres.
