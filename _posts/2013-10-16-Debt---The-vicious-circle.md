For most of us, vicious circle in the context of debt, refers to the inability and continued need to borrow to maintain status quo.

For the government however, there is a whole new meaning to it.

Congress approves budgets each year, which the President is expected/ mandated to spend.

Here’s how the vicious circle goes:

*   _Congress asks Government to spend money it doesn’t have_
*   _Government needs money to execute the budget, hence borrows_
*   _Debt levels need to be increased, which only Congress can approve_
*   _Congress won’t approve_

Happy Debt Ceiling Politics Day ;)

PS: My guess [remains](http://kuppurao.com/2013/10/10/budget-debt-crisis/ "Budget/ Debt Crisis – What’s coming?") that something will happen tonight, the drama will be interesting nevertheless
