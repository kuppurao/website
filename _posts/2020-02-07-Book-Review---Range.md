### Book Review — Range {#1080 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="1080"}

A very interesting book that discusses learning methods, early vs late
specialization, generalists vs specialists and so much more. Be sure to
read about the 3 other books you should consider.

Having written more than 35 book reviews, mostly as a method to improve
my own retention value of the book, I have come to realize a book review
is not a book review at all. At least mine are not. Instead, they turn
out to be my perspectives of the book.

Have you ever wondered how some of the most successful CEOs or people in
leadership positions, do not have the academic or sometimes even the
experiential background of the business they manage? Lawyers run
companies, engineers run some, CFOs become CEOs etc. Even at a narrower
level, several business units are run by people who didnt necessarily
grow up doing work related to that discipline. Park that thought.

I have been very intrigued by a statement I heard somewhere. This is the
first time in the history of the world where parents don’t have enough
of an insight with any degree of uncertainty to ask their children to
study this or that. I have watched and/or read several authors on these
lines — including, most prominently — Gladwell, Godin and Harari.

Harari — I am oversimplifying, I admit — basically says to learn to
learn fast and adapt quickly to changing job landscape is the key to
being relevant. Gladwell most famously popularized the 10,000 hours
concept — that if you have to be good at anything, you need to have
practiced that for 10,000 hrs. He also warned parents to start early,
identify innate talents, and keep at it. Godin, in his book called The
Dip, tells that the adage of “never give up” is a sham. He urges people
to give up often — just as soon as you realize you have spent long
enough in one thing to realize it is not your thing.

Meanwhile, I was curious about my kids’ futures, and my own. What should
I learn? How should I expect to be relevant 5–10–15 years from now? For
whatever I learn now, it is going to be vestigial in some
way — replaced, automated or something else.

I usually my book choices carefully — because I suck at reading. I rely
on famous book critics. Not the commercial “bestseller” types of
critics — but people that critique or laud the content of these books.
My 2 favorite go-to’s are Bill Gates and Fareed Zakaria. I watched an
interview of Fareed’s with David Epstein, about his book called Range.

After reading about 1/2 of the book, I commented on Twitter that reading
Epstein along with Harari, Gladwell and Godin, will paradoxically cancel
out all the learning. Gladwell himself said “everything I thought about
something was wrong” while reviewing Range.

Range is a book that deals with a few core concepts

1.  To specialize or not to specialize — Should I become a pediatric
    pancreatic oncologist? Or should I become a general surgeon? Or a
    primary physician?
2.  Specialize early or specialize late — Tiger Woods specialized early
    and saw the entire world through golf. He did well. But so did
    Federer, who specialized very late, but no less accomplished than
    Woods.
3.  The value of wandering — Van Gogh did not know his value until much
    later in his life — closer to his death than when he was a child.
4.  And a few other related concepts — with ample examples and true
    stories of specialists and generalists, and their contributions
    thereof to humanity.

You cannot apply Epstein, or any of the other 3 (Gladwell, Godin and
Harari) in isolation. But processing the core concepts of all 4 of these
authors, I believe, provides a well-rounded perspective of what’s to
come.

Overall, it is a very good read and I highly recommend this book.

PS: I am beginning to form an opinion around non-fiction, single-concept
books and their authors. I am not sure if the authors lack brevity or
the publisher forces them to write x number of pages, for the reader to
perceive a book as being substantive enough. After reading Range, I am
convinced that I got 50–60% worth of his wisdom during Epstein’s
10-minute interview with Fareed Zakaria. While I was reading this book,
I heard about Ezra Klein’s Why We Are Polarized — now I am in dilemma
whether I should get the book, or just walk away with the content I got
from Klein’s interview with Zakaria. After all, if my theory is right, I
already know 70% of what he is about to say.
