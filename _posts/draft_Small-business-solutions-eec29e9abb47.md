Chances are you have a small business, even a family organization, where you would like to host websites and email in the most cost effective way.

In this article, I explore how it can be achieved using the best of leading providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

#### The website

What are you looking for in a website? Is it an actual ecommerce portal or is it a simple website serving static pages? If there are dynamic elements, are they server-based code (such as PHP, .Net) or can they be client-run (such as Javascripts)?

From my own experience, I would recommend Google and I would discourage you to use Amazon.

#### Apps and websites

This is a tricky item. You can be a regular user, not able or not wanting to deal with complexities, have simple apps like a blog. Free blogs do not offer customization, domain integration etc..Premium blogs can be hosted on Amazon, Microsoft or Google. If you would like a super-simple setup of a Virtual Private Server, you could try Digital Ocean. Microsoft also has a
