[Humming Now](http://kuppurao.com/blog/category/entertainment/music-entertainment/humming-now/) is a series of posts, taking a glimpse of music, one raga at a time. That raga is the reference point of my posts, should hopefully not take away the fact that the music itself it [exoteric, not esoteric](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXnV5HzS7nA). Raga-based listening is truly a learning experience, even if you don’t know anything about them. For example, I try to associate songs of the same raga, but don’t know anything about the ragas themselves.

If you want to follow someone, who does the same thing as I do, but with a little bit of more technical flair to it, you might want to consider [Charulatha Mani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charulatha_Mani) — she has a television series as well as DVD collection of a set of ragas — with focus on the technicalities of the raga and a glimpse of popular music, although I must warn you — her singing has much to be desired.

Also, in my informal learning experience, I have developed a tendency to associate certain ragas with certain musicians — only because they are skilled in bringing out the best of that raga. One of the best examples, and the topic for this post, is the raga [Hamsanadam](http://www.karnatik.com/ragash.shtml#hamsanAdam).

If you want to get a taste of Hamsanadam, look no further — just listen to TN Seshagopalan — it doesn’t matter which song you pick, what length you pick — he is, IMO, most capable of bringing out the essence of this raga.

Of course, when it comes to popular music, there are several examples — I would like to highlight two songs. _Isaiyil Thodangudhamma_ is a song sung by [Ajoy Chakrabarty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajoy_Chakrabarty), one of the best Hindustani singers. This song comes to my mind, immediately after TN Seshagopalan’s Bantureeti. If you have a more folkish taste, there cannot be a better example than Sorgame Endraalum. While both songs are composed by [Ilayaraja](http://kuppurao.com/blog/tag/ilayaraja/), he is also credited for writing the first one and singing the second one.
