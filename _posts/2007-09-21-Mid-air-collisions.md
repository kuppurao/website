Back then, we used to do lot of manual, labor-intensive, time-consuming work anytime we need information about something. These days it is really simple. When the question is “where”, you go to [google.com](http://www.google.com). When the question is “what”, you go to [wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org)

Anyways, topic in discussion — [mid-air collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-air_collision) (MAC)

How many times have you looked out the window while flying? Have you seen planes other than yours? I have. Atleast a couple of times while cruising and many times during descent.

Everytime I see this, I begin to think — how dangerous can a MAC be?

Wikipedia reports 21 MACs and most notably, 13 of them inside the United States, almost all of them involving a non-commercial aircraft, mostly privates.

Makes me think whats wrong with [ATC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control) here!

Of course, the deadliest ever MAC occurred when a Kazak pilot breached ATC instructions while descending to New Delhi airport in India. Reason for the [death of 349 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Charkhi_Dadri_air_mishap) — Lack of English language skills on part of the Kazak pilot.
