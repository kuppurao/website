I have got a terrible habit of not completing books that I take up. I usually require phenomenal effort to finish those final pages. Despite, one book that I completed in incredibly short span of time is Robert Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”.

After having read that book and graduated to several other books, I feel Robert has done a good job of teaching the alphabets and numerals of, what can be termed as, the mightier world based on them!

A sensible book to be added to your bookshelves and your brains!
