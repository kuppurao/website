“It’s **_my_** life” you scream. I get that — but how many of us show that in action? Too many times we blame a bad boss, bad timing, bad luck, bad horoscope, bad destiny, bad friends, bad parents, bad school, bad raising, bad fate, bad coincidence, bad teachers, bad choices etc…

I am not here to speculate the existence and/or influence of any of these factors on our lives. For a moment, let’s pretend they do affect us. So what? It’s our reaction to these “bad” things that count. If those “bad” things themselves can determine the outcome of our lives, with no ability on our part to do anything about it, what are we more than mere spectators of our own lives? Where did “It’s my life” go?

Our lives are defined by how we react to the situations thrown at us. How we maneuver ourselves through them to define what we want and achieve it. Too often, we cave in to the tempting position where we can blame these factors and then bask in inaction. And sometimes it is okay to do it, but believing that we can — if we so opt — change it is the single most important realization we will ever have, and will define our role in your lives.
