After more than a year of wait, I finally got my DVD copy of [Margazhi Raagam](http://www.margazhiraagam.com/) — the cinema format music concert by TM Krishna and Bombay Jayashree. I like the idea and I think this is how every music concert ought to be videographed. Other than the musicians, PC Sreeramand Satish Kurosowa stood out clearly in this work of art.

This album reminded me of this ragam which I have been humming since and now — Reethigowlai

Fav#1: Janani Ninnuvina by Bombay Jayashree (courtesy: Margazhi Raagam)

Lite#1: [Thalaiyai Kuniyum Thamaraiye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StH2QX65Ws0) (Oru Odai NadhiyAgiradhu / Ilayaraja)

Lite#2: Azhagana Ratchasiye (Mudhalvan / AR Rehman)

Of course, it will be a sin to not mention [Chinna Kannan Azhaikiraan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Balamuralikrishna), but throughout the time I listened to Bombay Jayashree, Thalaiyai Kuniyum was haunting me. Hence skipped CKA and included TKT.

I also couldn’t help remembering Rajesh (if I know him well, he might never read this blog) for his love of Reethigowlai and Adithi because of my mention of AR Rehman for the first time.

PS: Janani Ninnuvina was not my most fav from this album. What is favorite will most likely be the “[Humming now #9](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2010/01/humming-now-9/ "Humming now #9")”. Hang tight.
