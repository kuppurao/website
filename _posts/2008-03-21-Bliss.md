Its 4:17am. Came home from work late. Got stuff to do before I head back to work at 7am.

Happened to see this video. I have no idea why — but the moment I saw this, there’s tears in my eyes. Shrinivas has such profound effect on me not just because he is a prodigy but also because of his flamboyance, speed, improvisational skills and body language. Perhaps he is born with all this.
