I believe it was in ’99 or 2000 when I met this maestro of Violin. I dont recall how I found his coordinates or for that matter, how he let me spend an hour of his time at his place in Balaji Nagar, Royapettah, Chennai.

There are few people in India — that I am aware of — that actually have taken to orchestra style western music and continue to maintain the rich tradition and value carnatic music has got to offer.

If you have not figured out who I am talking about, he is Mr. VS Narasimhan. He leads the quartet of 4 fiddlers who play music not for living, not for business — but pure passion.

Their album Resonance is a testimony to their imagination and the moment-of-truth for this blog item. You will do yourself great musical favor by buying this album.

Buy it, please.
