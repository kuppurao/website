Namesake had been one of the stories that affected me on multiple levels. I have watched the movie over and over. In reading Jhumpa’s [Lowland](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lowland-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0307265749), I partially fill the one gap — the fact that I never had read the book [Namesake](http://www.amazon.com/Namesake-Novel-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0618485228/ref=la_B001H6GTG0_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382537833&sr=1-3). There are several things about Lowland that helped me imagine how Namesake might have been written.

Jhumpa has recurring themes between Namesake and Lowland — story moving back and forth between India (_specifically Kolkata, West Bengal_) and America (_specifically the North East, with occasional references of California_), her focus on Bengali traditions and rituals, the labor of love (_husband/ wife and parents/ children in Namesake, siblings, couple, father-daughter and later granddaughter in Lowland_), teething issues and culture shocks of an Indian getting used to America (_from big questions such as “Should I raise my child in America?” to small details like coin-op laundry_), the period in which the stories took place (_around the 70s — not sure if it was done specifically to target a certain generation of readers or purely for creative reasons_), back-dropping the story with political events of the period (_certainly more pronounced in Lowland than in Namesake_), some returning motifs (_such as Ashima waiting for Ashok at the window in Namesake, and Gauri waiting for Udayan in the terrace in Lowland_) and so many others I may not have captured here.

But the recurrences end there — Lowlands is certainly more political, filled with more drama, covers a longer period (_almost 3.5 generations as opposed to 2 in Namesake_), references to many current day topics (_premarital/ extramarital/ homosexual relationships, single parents, the role of Internet in our lives — none of which are present in Namesake_) and almost tied the story to the specific locales (_Namesake could be moved to anywhere in India and anywhere in America, but Lowland pretty much is tied to Kolkata in India and Rhode Island in US_)

Ultimately, this novel is almost as compelling as Namesake, however I have to say I have not read the two other books by the same author. In some ways, I thought the author got bolder, in some others clichéd.

Throughout the latter part of the book, I could not help imagining Irfan Khan as the face for Subhash. One part of me imagines/ hopes that this book too will land in the hands of Mira Nair for a movie by the same name, another part of me likes to explore a different director and a entirely different cast — freeing the author from the stereotype of a franchise. It, however, certainly deserves to be a movie.
