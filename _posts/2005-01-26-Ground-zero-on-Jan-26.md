I have no credentials to talk about others, especially when it comes to their superficiality or lack of patriotism. For a simple reason that, I am no patriotic. But doesnt your sense patriotism get tested when you are personally in a state of despair? With no intention of comparing, I found the following incident ringing a bell somewhere in my mind. This is the picture of a teacher and pupils of a public school in Nagapattinam, the Indian ground zero of the just-one-month-old tsunami, observing the republic day.
