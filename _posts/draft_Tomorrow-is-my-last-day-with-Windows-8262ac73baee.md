I am looking forward to tomorrow. In 24 hrs from now, I will be transferring my apps and data over to a new Macbook, in what I would like to be a one-way journey from Windows to Mac. I now have a Windows 10 and a Macbook Air. With this change, all my laptops will be running some version of MacOS.

Big thanks

Windows practically taught me computers. The ease of use, the similarities it shared with the server versions (which I had to learn in my job) are simply too great to be left unacknowledged. Windows also came a long way since Windows 3.1 which is the first version I used.

But no thanks

1.  Its 2018. Windows still hasn’t lost their BSOD. A friend of mine lost all his data, thanks to BSOD.
2.  Anti-trust
