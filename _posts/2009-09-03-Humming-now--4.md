In August of 200&, I first blogged announcing the new series of blog-posts called “Humming Now” which would strive to appreciate the beauty of carnatic music, one raga at a time. I never really kept with it. I would like to revive it, so here you go:

Raagam: Shanmukhapriya

Fav#1 Vilayada Idhu Nerama — Maharajapuram Ramachandran

Fav#1 Parvathi Nayagane — Kunnakudi Vaidhyanathan (jugals with Zakir)

Lite#1 Kaadhal Kasakkudhaiyya (Aan Paavam / Ilayaraja)

Lite#2 Takita Tadimi (Salangai Oli / Ilayaraja)

About the series: One of things I mentioned early on about this series is that this wont be a [bot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot). I only post things that are lingering in my mind. That doesn’t mean there’s been no music in my mind for the last 14 months — there’s always music in my mind :-)
