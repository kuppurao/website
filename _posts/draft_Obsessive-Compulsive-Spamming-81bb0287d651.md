Obsessive Compulsive Spamming

Somewhere I read spams contribute 80% of Internet email traffic. There are improvements made in anti-spamming technologies, but not enough to prevent the naive and gullible person from clicking that link. However, that’s not the topic. 

This discussion is about another category of spams – this doesn’t come from Russia or China – but from your friend, your loved ones, your alumni.

First off, there is a whole town of people “originating” spams. These messages – usually image, but could be text, video, dubmash, meme (none that a traditional spam filter will catch) – are actually created by someone. Who are they? Why do they do this? Is it just the joy of creating, no matter the subject of creation? And why do they forward? Is it the sense of desperation – understandable for a creator – to be understood? To be appreciated? To make sure her message – however trivial, fictitious or tasteless it may be – reaches others? Is she creating this for just a couple of friends to see? Or does she know that it may reach thousands – perhaps millions – of people? I believe in many cases, they possibly create it for a Closed User Group and then the phenomenon takes over. Most of us won’t have an originator in our 1st degree (you are damned if you do)

The Phenomenon 

When you get a non-personal message, and you decide to forward, you do it because a) you want your recipients to share your feeling b) you want your recipients to know that you are capable of appreciating the message you just got. Both of them are fundamental human emotions. With emotions, the first thing that goes out the window is logic. Logic will tell them it is false or stupid or lousy – but that momentary pleasure you get from pushing the forward button (or the million ways in which you actually do that) is something that not just needs condemnation, but needs a whole sub-discipline of psychology dedicated to it.
