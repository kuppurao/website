I will forever admire the spirit of partnership between Amazon and Netflix and the total firewalling of their individual interests. 

When Netflix went “all-in” AWS couple of years ago, everyone commented “how come?”  —  after all Amazon Prime Videos is a fierce competitor of Netflix and it could be argued that Amazon narrowed the marketshare of Netflix, even if by a few decimal points. But Netflix knew something very well  —  that Amazon was not going to mess with the conflicting nature of their retail business, of which Videos are a part, and the massive hosting business which is to deliver the same level of service  —  whether the workload supports Netflix or another competitor or Amazon themselves.
