The problem with most articles on saving money is as follows -

They all assume you are at the lowest level. Someone that has tons of debt, hasn’t gotten around to saving a single $, considers paying the minimum balance a great feat, considers coupon clipping a smart move, does not have basic intelligence on interest (let alone compound interest), perhaps relies on credit cards for part of their expenses, don’t know the first thing about budgets. And on and on. 

Well, let’s say you are someone that uses credit cards very much but never have paid anything ever in interest charges and fancy fees, someone who knows the basics of the budget or even currently in a budget regime, you have basic financial discipline and you are looking to be smart with money. 

This is the space very few writers specialize in. 

Of course, there are financial planners that consult, for a fee or for return business, but they are too long-term. 

But, following topics in my opinion are under-covered -

1.  Credit card strategy (yes, there is such a thing) 
2.  How much (uninvested) cash is too much cash. What to do with it.
3.  Economics of rent vs buy, lease vs finance
