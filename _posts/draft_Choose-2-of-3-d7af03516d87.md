Choose 2 of 3

We are familiar with the triad of quality, speed and price. For any given product, we can expect 2 but not all of these 3 things. 

Similarly, I come up with another triad. It is Customer, Investor and Employee. You can be customer and investor — you enjoy the benefits of being the customer of a customer-focused company, but because they are so customer focused, you can also invest in them. You can be customer and employee — you enjoy being a servant and the served. You can also be employee and investor — you believe so much in the value you are helping create, regardless they add value to the customer or not. 

Examples

Amazon — customer and shareholder. Not employee?
