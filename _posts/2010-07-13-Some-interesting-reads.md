I follow plenty of blogs — more than hundred of them. Google reader makes life simple, but apparently not simple enough. Because I find myself ignoring feeds many of the times by clicking _mark as read_. But I went back to my _starred_ feeds from a long time; following are what would have to be called my favorites based on my own reading patterns:

*   [TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/rss) — For starters, TED means Technology — Entertainment — Design. I started watching this in 2007 and I have seen some [fascinating speeches](http://www.ted.com/profiles/view/id/362855).
*   Devdutt Pattanaik — One of the leaders TED introduced to me was [Devdutt](http://www.devdutt.com/feed). He provided me [some insights of East V West](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/devdutt_pattanaik.html) I had never heard before. His blogs are interesting. He even made me [read a book](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2010/03/book-review-a-handbook-of-hindu-mythology/ "Book Review: A Handbook of Hindu Mythology").
*   [Sriram V](http://sriramv.wordpress.com/feed/) — Chennai. Carnatic Music. 2 subjects I absolutely like and he is absolutely passionate about. Stumped by his insight, knowledge and amore of Chennai especially. I have bought a book of his that combines both subjects, but have yet to start reading.
*   [Seth Godin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin) — His books (one of which [I have read](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2010/04/book-review-linchpin/ "Book Review: Linchpin")) are the answer to my many questions in the areas of business and leadership. More than his books, [his blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/typepad/sethsmainblog) offers thought-provoking 100-word tid-bits every day.

I read lots of news, but this is also where I do most of my _mark as read_ sins. I try to follow long-term themes such as economy/finance, energy/climate etc…If you just want to follow the big guys, read everything [Paul Krugman](http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/label/Paul%20Krugman) reads or [Tom Friedman](http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/-/label/Thomas%20Friedman) reads.
