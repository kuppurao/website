“We need you to update your details” says an email I received from Bank of America. Unless you are very seasoned, savvy and understood a little bit of technology, if you receive that email, chances are, you will think that email came from Bank of America. 

I have always thought all the advancements in security have not been enough to help a 70 year old, or even a 50 year old tell a real email from a phishing email. 

I decided to send myself to see what they do.
