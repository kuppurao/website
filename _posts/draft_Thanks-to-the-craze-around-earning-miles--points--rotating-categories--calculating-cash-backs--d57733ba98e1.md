Thanks to the craze around earning miles/ points, rotating categories, calculating cash backs, recovering the annual fee money and weird acts, a credit card has evolved to be much more than a device that provides access to revolving credit. To me, it’s a bonus if the people that see it (friends/ merchants) pause to ask me “which card is that?”

I recently got the most pricey credit card of my life. One that attracts a huge $450 per year just to own it. But does it look it? I doubt that. I have consistently had people ask me about the Amex Bluecash for its world famous transparent look.
