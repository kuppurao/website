Is private cloud still a thing?

When AWS and Azure started becoming popular, several organizations responded with their promise of a Private Cloud — for whatever reason — real, perceived or postured. 

Fundamentally, Private Cloud has some inherent deficiencies.

1.  Higher cost or time or both to get the damn thing working. 
2.  Limits innovation to the individual organization. 
3.  It is still very, very capex-heavy
4.  Resource arbitrage is not possible

Public clouds are vastly popular because -

1.  True economies of scale, innovation to bring the cost down. PCPs reduce price all the time, not sure that is the case with private. 
2.  PCP is available as a product to the consumer. In case of private cloud, it just becomes an unending saga of feature development, backlog management etc. All this assuming basic availability is well-delivered.
