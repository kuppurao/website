When refrigerators became an in-thing in the towns I lived in during the 80s and 90s, everyone bought along with their fridge another thing. This thing costed 10% if not more of the fridge price, and was billed as (the fridge) “never to be used without this”

This thing of course is the stabilizer. Back then, we used to get poor quality of power — so a stabilizer was needed to make sure the fridge continued to function.

The amazing thing is that the fridge companies never seized this opportunity. The people that made these stabilizers were effectively making additional money on a product that they didnt have to do anything to sell.

Anytime something gets done for a prolonged period of time, it becomes established, it becomes the truth, it becomes a norm in a way any other scenario was just not conceivable.

Today, more than 25 years after I saw a fridge (replete with the stabilizer), I see another one. And yes, with the stabilizer. And with a desperate cry on the fridge face, on a sticker, the maker says “will work without stabilizer”
