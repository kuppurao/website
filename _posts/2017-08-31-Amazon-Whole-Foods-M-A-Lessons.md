If article is anything, it is original and honest and there’s that. All parents were once a child. Most parents give their blood and sweat and a part of themselves to their children. Most parents are not just the financiers, but people who forsook or compromised their dreams to favor little things for their children. I know of no parents in my circle who would wish anything less than the best for their little ones.

Of course, none of these entitle a parent to say or do mean things to their child. And it is _okay_ if someone doesn’t love their parents back. But to make an -ism out of it is a stretch.

I am not trolling, trashing or offended. This feeling is also a point-in-time feeling. How I will feel 10 yrs from now, who knows? ;)
