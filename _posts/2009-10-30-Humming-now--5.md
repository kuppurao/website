When I published my [#4](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2009/09/humming-now-4/ "Humming now #4") on this series (Shanmukhapriya), [Adithi](http://adithikoushik.blogspot.com/)had pointed out that all of my “lite” mentions are composed by Ilayaraja and that I am being partial. I promised to take that feedback and include non-IR songs as well.

But hey, I am writing about [Kalyani](http://www.karnatik.com/ragask.shtml#kalyANi). It is only fair that I not only include IR songs, but dedicate this whole post to him.

Since I am not trained, I can only visualize and provide a structure to the raga through emotions of my own, often unexplainable in words.

Perhaps I can do a poll on which is the best Kalyani created ever. Of course, all 3 options have to be IR compositions.

Kaatril Varum Geethame (from Oru Naal Oru Kanavu)

Vandhaal Mahalakshmi (from Uyarndha Ullam)

Janani Janani (from Thaai Mookambigai)
