Rehost, replatform, refactor and replace are the 4 key strategies when it comes to Cloud migration. 

Rehost essentially means moving the machine images of the current servers and moving them to Cloud, making ZERO changes to the infrastructure or application architecture. Where the current OS is not supported on Cloud, you will Replatform it. Rehost and Replatform represent a large % of IaaS use cases. Migration of DBs to highly Cloud-provider provided DB platforms is also sometimes considered Replatform. 

Replace essentially means the entire application gets replaced by a commercial offering, usually a PaaS product or a SaaS product. 

The complex piece is Refactor. These are legacy applications, monolithic applications or even n-tier applications but those that are highly stateful – it just means they can’t yet take advantage of the Cloud until they have been refactored. Simple Refactor examples include decoupling components, enabling the application components for scalability, resilience and elasticity. Complex Refactor essentially means the application is re-written from scratch. 

There is no one strategy that is good or bad. Enyerpro
