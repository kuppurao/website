Or so [says CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/03/pf/cost_of_waiting/index.htm?section=money_topstories&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fmoney_topstories+%28Top+Stories%29). But the study ignores the fact that $38 billion includes many hours, whose worthiness is defined very loosely, often assuming that the people that wait don’t do anything worthy during that time. Most salaried people continue to get paid, in several industries, it is possible to be productive while working from home.

On the other hand, when I waged a war with my cable company, when they give me a ridiculously long window and didn’t show up anyways, I basically said “my time is worth $100 per hour….therefore you owe me $400 for your no-show”. They politely said, “your being a customer to us is worth $30 bucks a month….we are happy to have you leave us or we can pay $1 for the mistake we did”.
