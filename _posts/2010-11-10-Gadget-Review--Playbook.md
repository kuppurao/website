Apple revolutionized phones and tablets, but that’s not to say they will continue to be leaders forever. Their adamancy (,arrogance) and relative slowness to change has made sure competitors make terrific products, often better ones at that.

As a company, Apple has succeeded whether fiscally or in terms of pop status. But Apple also knew there is one market which hadn’t / hasn’t quite started looking at Apple — **the enterprise**. Apple has made lots of investments in the enterprise space lately, but it is too early to say whether they are paying off.

Which is where Blackberry’s entry into tablet market — the _Playbook_ — has a inherent advantage. Blackberry and enterprise almost go together and Playbook just extends the phenomenon to the tablet. Of course, every tablet has to have features that Apple doesn’t (variety of I/O ports, Flash support, expandable storage, a more attractive App store, non-limiting access to music), but Blackberry is uniquely positioned because of its corporate-friendliness. That advantage doubles when they claim you don’t need a data plan, just tether it to your existing BB’s 3G plan.

Playbook is very promising.
