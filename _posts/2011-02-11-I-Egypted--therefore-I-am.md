If you are a journalist or a blogger or anyone who respects your own views and thoughts and those of others; and if you did not write about today, you just missed one of the best things pass by. For, like Obama said, and I agree, there are very few moments where you see history taking place and [today’s events in Egypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_protests) is definitely one of them.

I was particularly moved by the fact that the liberation of the people of Egypt from their autocratic leader happened without terror or any large-scale violence. I was particularly pleased by the reassurance that hunger (in this case for democracy and justice) can bring just about any change.

As one of my friends said, “It’s a nice day to be an Egyptian”!

But tearing a government down is only 1/4th of the river crossed, the remaining 3/4th will be crossed in the reconstruction of the country.

All the best Egypt!
