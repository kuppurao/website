Its [not](http://kuppurao.com/blog/2010/04/review-iphone-os-4-0/ "Review – iPhone OS 4.0") my first time telling you this — don’t waste time on what others think about iphone 4 (or any apple product)

Watch the keynote [here](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1006ad9g4hjk/event/index.html) (and make your own judgements)

My verdict on iphone 4: It is the most “loaded” iphone yet, but looks awkward.

My verdict on Jobs’ Keynote performance: For a $50 billion enterprise, he must be extremely powerful to be synonymated (is that a word?) with the Apple brand, but his keynotes are becoming clichéd. Change your game, Steve!
