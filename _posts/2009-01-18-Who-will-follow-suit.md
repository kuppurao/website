You dont have to look at the share prices, P/L statements and CEO compensations to ascertain the fate of certain companies, which would have had a difficult time always but the ill-fated economy will expose them and cause them to liquidate or go bankrupt or at the very least — change the fundamentals of how their business operates.

Simple things like customer experience, price points, staff competency, cleanliness of restrooms tell us a big deal about where the company is headed.

We just saw Circuit City.

Who will follow suit?

One of my guesses is Radioshack.

What do you think?
