I think I may be fully capable of or close to fully capable of flying into a city, meet someone – a client, a business partner, or a colleague – and come back home, and, in many cases, forget which city I went to our some in rare cases not even know what city I went to. 

Let me explain. 

It all starts with the phone. My air travel and hotel reservations are arranged online and show up as boarding passes and reservation cards on my phone. This whole explanation assumes that you have done the reservations right, there is no error/ snafu etc. 

I go to the airport, pull out my phone for boarding pass and my ID. I get past security and all I am focusing on is the gate number. I have precheck which means my mental state need not be disturbed by the need to remove anything – laptops, jackets, shoes etc. I travel so often these days I have not beeped at the security scanner in as long a time as I can remember. 

So get to the gate, board the plane, find my place. Obviously I am tired of making conversations with rowmates. I don’t expect them to be curious about me and I am not curious about them. 

I get off the plane and I am looking for baggage claim. Not that I have baggage to claim, because I travel so often, I can pack for 10 days not needing to check a bag. But because I need to find the pickup point for Uber. This is where all cities start to become the same for me. You punch the address in the app – and unless you initiate, most rides are conversation-less. 

Now I get to the hotel and usually don’t have to meet the person up front because they make phone keys for your room. You get to your room and the night’s over. 

Next day, I go about my routine – which is all business – I could be in Minneapolis or Orlando or Des Moines or Portland ME – it doesn’t make any difference to me.

Coming back it is the same routine. Uber to Airport to Precheck to Gate to Gate to Baggage Claim to Uber to my house. Now tell me which part of this is unique to any city? Or has discernable difference between city 1 and city 2?
