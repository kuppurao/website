> 'I don’t have any particular specialist skills. I have sort of a vague knowledge of everything' - [Yokoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi)

My resume as follows: 

	Didn't know much -> Knew a little –> Knew some more –> Thought I knew a lot –> Realized I don't know much -> Have officially removed the word 'expert' from my lexicon.

Music and technology get me as excited, as do economics, foreign policy and politics. Grew up listening to [Ilayaraja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilaiyaraaja) and [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti_%28band%29), now listen to an assortment of music, mostly Jazz and [Carnatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music). My journey to find my music is very interesting - I will probably find a way to write it while not boring the readers. Some of my favorite albums are listed in the music page. In my world, there is no drummer beyond [Zakir Hussain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29). Currently listening to [Chris Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Potter_%28jazz_saxophonist%29) a lot. I can be *fed* any music - even [scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntablism) - so long as there is an element of raga in it. Very temperamental about the kind of movies I'd like to watch. In my book, [Shawshank Redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption) is yet to be overtaken as the best movie of all times. Trying to overcome my reading handicap, through reading a lot. I write book reviews primarily to maximize my retention, and by publishing them, I make you - the reader - a collateral beneficiary. Usually take reading recos from [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books) or [Fareed Zakaria](https://www.bookadvice.co/fareed-zakaria.html). I failed at standup comedy before I attempted it.
