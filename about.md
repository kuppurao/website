# Hola

I don’t have any particular specialist skills. I have sort of a vague knowledge of everything - Yokoi

![enter image description here](/assets/biopic.jpg)My resume as follows: Didn’t know much –> Knew a little –> Knew some more –> Thought I knew a lot –> Realized I dont know much

Music and technology get me as excited, as do economics, foreign policy and politics. Grew up listening to Ilayaraja and Shakti, now listen to an assortment of music, mostly Jazz and Carnatic. There is no drummer beyond Zakir Hussain. Currently listening to Chris Potter a lot. Trying to overcome my reading handicap, through reading a lot. Usually take recos from Bill Gates or Fareed Zakaria. I failed at standup comedy before I attempted it.
